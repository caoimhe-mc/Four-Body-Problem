# Four-Body-Problem
This asiignment was completed for a Level 3 module called Modelling and Simulation. The aim is to solve a four body solar system that includes the Earth, the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter, by reading initial conditions for the postion and the velocity of each planet.
The equation of motion for each planet was determined using Newton's first and second law of motion. 
The equations of motion were solved using the Fourth-Order RUnge Kutta method.
A visualization for results obtained was made.
This assignment was completed with two other students.
